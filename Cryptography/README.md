# Algorithms to Encrypt or Decrypt Messages
This repository contains code I write when playing around with different cryptographic alorithms. Main idea is to create a huge class that will provide easy
and accessible way to encrypt or decrypt input messages.


## Rail Fence Cipher
* rail_OOP.py: Rail Fence cipher written in OOP, can be easily imported from elsewhere;
* rail_fence_cipher_encryption.py: One of the classic American Civil War ciphers, simple implementation.

## Route Cipher
* route_OOP.py: Route cipher written in OOP, can be easily imported from elsewhere;
* route_cipher.py: One of the classic American Civil War ciphers, simple implementation.
