# Projects
This repository contains codes for small projects I write for fun.

## Cryptopgraphy
Different ciphers and programs that can break them. So far, it is planned to explore union route cipher, rail fence cipher and Ceasers cipher. Programs that will crack these ciphers will come shortly after ciphers are done. 

## Fox_Chicken_Corn
Solution for the classic puzzle, where a person has a task to bring 3 of his belongings, namely a fox, chicken and a bag of corn, across the river using a small boat that can only carry 1 belonging. The person can not leave fox and chicken alone on a shore, and also chicken and corn can not be left alone. The solution is all the actions the person takes to move all 3 belongings, provided by Depth First Search algorithm.

## Output_Patterns
Testing the limitations and possibilities of output patterns that can be done using only for loops, new lines and spaces. Everything here will be done in C++. Furthermore, run-length encoding of the image will also be explored, to output the image in ASCII symbols.

## Palingrams
Codes that search a dictionary and find palindromes, palingrams, make sentences with palingrams etc.

## TSP
Solution to Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with two algorithms, namely Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Simulated Annealing (SA). Later will be incorporated into my project of making a traveling map of Russia.
